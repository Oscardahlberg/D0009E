This program contains 3 different ways to create a dictionary, one is through the use of two lists where one list is the word
and the second one is the definition where they same share the same index.
The second is using a list of tuple pairs where the first index in the tuple is the word and the second index is the definiton
Example: list_of_tuple[0][0] = word, list_of_tuple[0][1] = definition
The third way is using a dictionary where the keys is the word and the keyhole is the definition
